github-map
==========

This is a simple, single-page, web application that generates a map of public repositories and watchers for a given github user.

Instructions:

make

This should bring in all the npm dependencies and kick off the node server. Simply navigate to http://localhost:8080.

Have fun!

NOTE: To increase the ping'ing bandwidth, establish an authenticated connection to the github api by filling in your <USERNAME> and <PASSWORD> in the node server backend (server.js)
